# Customer-Segmentation
#Project Idea: 
To perform data analysis on the customer transaction data.
This project involves analyzing customer transaction data, which involves analyzing the customer purchases.
Using data analysis techniques this dataset is analyzed in excel.
Things analyzed in this project are Data Cleaning, Trend Analysis,  A Particular Persons Analysis, Purchase Modes and Customer Analysis. 
First, did the data cleaning to better understand the data by removing the duplicate values and sorting the data and forming a table to make it look more presentable.
Then to find the trends i.e, how many purchases are being done in the span of 3 months, did trend analysis with the help of formulas.
Later i wanted to find a particular persons data, for that i have performed some analysis using pivot tables to get a persons data. 
I also wanted to know the purchase modes by doing customer analysis, which tells with which mode of purchase the sales where more and with which there are less.
Finally, i created a dashborad to show the final overview of the different analysis performed.
